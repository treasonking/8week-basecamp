CVE-2024-3094: xz Utils Backdoor Incident (2024)
Summary: A malicious backdoor was inserted into xz Utils releases 5.6.0 and 5.6.1,
impacting certain Linux distributions. The payload modified liblzma to weaken sshd
authentication on systems using systemd and the patched liblzma, enabling potential
remote unauthorized access. Distributions quickly reverted to 5.4.x.
Mitigation: downgrade xz to 5.4.x, verify package signatures, audit sshd, and
monitor for suspicious CPU usage during sshd start. Vendors issued advisories.
